# 🚀 JavaScript Level 2: Logic & Data Manipulation

These tasks will challenge your ability to combine what you've learned to solve real-world coding problems.

---

### 1. The Dynamic Multiplier
**Topic:** Functions & Loops  
**Task:** Write a function called `multiplicationTable(num)`.
**Goal:** When the function is called, it should use a `for` loop to log the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10.
*Example output for 5:* `5 * 1 = 5`, `5 * 2 = 10`...

---

### 2. The Array Summation
**Topic:** Arrays & Loops  
**Task:** Create an array of numbers: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`.
**Goal:** Use a loop to calculate the **total sum** of all numbers in the array and log it to the console.

---

### 3. The "Secret Word" Checker
**Topic:** String Methods & Conditionals  
**Task:** Create a variable `password = "JavaScript123"`.
**Goal:** Write a script that checks:
1. If the password is longer than 8 characters.
2. If it contains the word "Java".
Log "Strong Password" if both are true, otherwise log "Weak Password".

---

### 4. The User Profile Manager
**Topic:** Objects & Reassignment  
**Task:** Create an object `user` with `name`, `email`, and `isAdmin` (boolean).
**Goal:** 1. Add a new property `lastLogin` with a string value.
2. Update the `isAdmin` property to the opposite of its current value using the `!` (NOT) operator.
3. Delete the `email` property.
Log the final object.

### 5. FizzBuzz (The Classic)
**Topic:** Logic & Modulo  
**Task:** Loop from 1 to 30.
**Goal:** * If a number is divisible by 3, log "Fizz".
* If a number is divisible by 5, log "Buzz".
* If divisible by **both** 3 and 5, log "FizzBuzz".
* Otherwise, just log the number.

### 6. The Array Filter
**Topic:** Arrays & Logic  
**Task:** You have an array: `let scores = [45, 80, 55, 92, 30, 75]`.
**Goal:** Create a new empty array called `passedScores`. Loop through `scores` and if a score is 60 or higher, `.push()` it into the `passedScores` array.

---

### 7. Temperature Converter
**Topic:** Math & Functions  
**Task:** Write an arrow function `toCelsius(fahrenheit)`.
**Goal:** Use the formula $C = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}$. 
Log the result for `98.6°F`. Use `.toFixed(1)` to show only one decimal.

---

### 8. The "includes" Search
**Topic:** Searching Arrays  
**Task:** Create an array of `shoppingList = ["Milk", "Eggs", "Bread", "Apples"]`.
**Goal:** Use an `if` statement with the `.includes()` method to check if "Sugar" is on the list. If not, log "Don't forget the sugar!" and `.push()` it to the list.

---

### 9. Object Loop (for...in)
**Topic:** Object Iteration  
**Task:** Create an object `car` with `make: "Toyota"`, `model: "Camry"`, and `year: 2022`.
**Goal:** Use a `for...in` loop to log every **key** and **value** in the format: `make: Toyota`.



---

### 10. The Countdown Timer
**Topic:** While Loops & Logic  
**Task:** Start a variable at `10`.
**Goal:** Use a `while` loop to count down to 0. 
1. Log each number.
2. When it hits 0, log "Blast off! 🚀".
